(1)Structure of a program
(2)Variables and types
    #Identifiers
        1. a sequence of one or more letters, digits or underscore characters.
        2. in no case can they begin with a digit.
        3. spcial compilers may have additional specific reserved key words.
        4. cpp is a case sensitive language;
    #Fundamental data types
        1. Character types.
        2. Numerical interger types.
        3. Floating-point types.
        4. Boolean type.
    #Declaration of variables
        1. every variable needs to be declared with its type before its fist use.
    #Initialization of variables
        1. initialize it from the same moment it is declared.
        2. constructor initialization.
        3. uniform initialization.
    #Type deduction
        1. auto
        2. decltype()
    #Introduction to strings
        1. the program needs to include the header <string>.
        2. as with fundamental types, all initialization formats are valid with strings.
